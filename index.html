			<h2> About Me </h2>

			<p> Hello, my name is Mike Kurtz.  I was born and raised in New Jersey and attended Muhlenberg College in Pennsylvania.  After school, I moved to Boston and have been living here ever since. </p>

			<p> Since graduating, I have been working at a software company called Crimson Hexagon.  I am currently employed as a Product Manager there.  I am taking this course to enhance my technical skills, which I feel is important for my profession.  </p>

			<p> I'm looking forward to a great semester! </p>

			<h2> About My Code Editor </h2>

			<p> Now that you know a little about me, here's a little about my code editor.  I am using Sublime Text 2, and I'm loving it.  I'm about to pay for a subscription.  Markup's a breeze with it! </p>
